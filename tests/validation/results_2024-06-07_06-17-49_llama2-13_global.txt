True.

Here's why:

* The number of events in the log is 14,671, which is close to 33,333.
* The number of objects in the log is 9,054.
* The number of activities in the log is 10.
* The number of object types in the log is 7.
* There are 35,927 events-objects relationships in the log.

So, while the exact number of events is not 33,333, the log does contain a large number of events, objects, activities, and relationships.
