Question: Are the activities Create Request for Quotation, Create Purchase Order, Approve Purchase Order included the lifecycle of ocel:oid "quotation:978197819781"?
<</PREFIX>>
<<ANSWER>> [/INST]
Model Answer:  I cannot directly answer that question based on the context provided. The context only includes details of five different OCEL oids, one of which has an oid "quotation:429". There is no mention of an oid "quotation:978197819781" in the provided context, so it would not be possible to determine if the specified activities are in its lifecycle based on this information alone.
Expected Answer: False
Verification Result: False
