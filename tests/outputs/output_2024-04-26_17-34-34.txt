Tell me everything you know about the Estimated arrival time activity

Answer:   Based on the provided context, I can tell you the following information about the Estimated arrival time activity:

* The activity is associated with two resources, Resource1 and Resource2.
* The activity has four instances, each with a different start time (0, 1, 2, and 3) and a different end time (10:00:00 - 22:00:00).
* The estimated arrival time for each instance is not explicitly stated in the provided context.

Please note that I cannot provide any information beyond what is explicitly stated in the context. If you have any further questions or need more information, please let me know and I will do my best to assist you.
