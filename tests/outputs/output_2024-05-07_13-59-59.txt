ocel:oid: quotation:98

Answer:   Based on the provided context, I can answer the question "ocel:oid: quotation:98" as follows:

The object with the specified ocel ID "quotation:98" is a purchase order with the following activities in its lifecycle:

* Create Request for Quotation
* Create Purchase Order
* Create Purchase Order
* Create Purchase Order
* Approve Purchase Order
* Approve Purchase Order
* Approve Purchase Order

The lifecycle start date is 2022-06-30 13:56:00+00:00 and the lifecycle end date is 2022-07-05 15:34:00+00:00, with a total duration of 437880 seconds (or approximately 14 days).

The interacting objects with this purchase order are:

* purchase_requisition:99:pr_trigger_99
* purchase_order:159
* purchase_order:158
* purchase_order:160

Therefore, the answer to the question "ocel:oid: quotation:98" is:

A purchase order with the specified ID, which has the following activities in its lifecycle and interacts with several other objects.

ocel:oid: quotation:0

Answer:   Based on the provided OCEL2.0 object summary, I do not see any information about a quotation with the ID "0". The provided context only shows information about specific purchase orders and purchase requisitions, as well as their corresponding lifecycles and interacting objects. Therefore, I cannot answer the question about a quotation with the ID "0" as there is no relevant information provided in the context.
