Is Procurement Department the only resource working on a purchase order object?

Answer:   Based on the provided context, I cannot determine if Procurement Department is the only resource working on a purchase order object. The given context shows the working calendar of multiple resources that manipulate objects of types "purchase_requisition", "quotation", and "purchase_order". However, it does not provide information on which resources work on specific objects or whether any resource works exclusively on purchase order objects. Therefore, I cannot answer the question with certainty.
