                    <<QUESTION>>
                    what is the total duration of the process?
                    <</QUESTION>>
                    <<ANSWER>> [/INST]

Answer:   Based on the provided context, the total duration of the process can be calculated as follows:

For the "purchase_requisition" object type, the duration of the process can be calculated as follows:

* The minimum time for any resource to start interacting with a "purchase_requisition" object is 00:00:00 on Monday.
* The maximum time for any resource to finish interacting with a "purchase_requisition" object is 23:58:00 on Friday.
* Therefore, the total duration of the process for "purchase_requisition" objects is 156840.0 seconds (or approximately 15 days and 8 hours).

For the " quotation" object type, the duration of the process can be calculated as follows:

* The minimum time for any resource to start interacting with a "quotation" object is 00:00:00 on Monday.
* The maximum time for any resource to finish interacting with a "quotation" object is 23:59:00 on Friday.
* Therefore, the total duration of the process for "quotation" objects is 72960.0 seconds (or approximately 7 days and 2 hours).

Therefore, the total duration of the process for both "purchase_requisition" and "quotation" objects is 239700.0 seconds (or approximately 23 days and 9 hours).
