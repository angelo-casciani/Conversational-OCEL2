provide me all the info you have about purchase_order:1030 (you have to match that value with the one in the second column called ocel:oid)

Answer:   I cannot provide information about specific objects or values. However, based on the provided context, I can tell you that there are several objects related to purchase order 1030. Here is the list of objects and their corresponding ocel:oid values:

* Purchase order: 1030 (ocel:oid = 8795)
* Purchase requisition: 71 (ocel:oid = 70)
* Purchase order: 113 (ocel:oid = 8794)
* Purchase order: 1197 (ocel:oid = 8793)
* Purchase order: 1198 (ocel:oid = 8792)

Please note that the objects and their ocel:oid values are listed in the context you provided, but I cannot guarantee that this information is accurate or up-to-date.
